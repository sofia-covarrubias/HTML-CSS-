**Project Name:** HTML/CSS | **Class Name:** Advanced Java Topics at Valley View High School | **Submission Date:** September 30, 2021 | **Description of Class:** In Advanced Java Topics, we are treated as real employees. Our teacher gives us resources to self-teach ourselves so that we may "learn how to learn." | **Description of Project:** Replit.com was used. My classmate were required to create four pages with specific tags like tables or hyperlinks. The style and aesthetic was extremely important as our "imaginary client" would notify us of what look they wanted the website to have. However, I created this project with the purpose of having a website template for my school club, Empowering Women w/ Code. For further questions regarding my club, feel free to contact me at thesofiacovarrubias@gmail.com. | **Partners and Info:** This was a solo project
