    <h3>What is EWC all about?</h3>
    <p>EWC (Empowering Women Through Code) is a girl's coding club at Valley View High School that allows us to creates a safe space for girls from all backgrounds who are interested in code.</p>

    <h3>Do I have to have any experience to join?</h3>
    <p>No, not at all! We specifically made this club for young women who are complete beginners. We want to remove the stigma that you have to be an anti-social, neckbeard, weird scrawny-looking person to become a programmer. Even out officers come from all different levels of coding experience. </p>
